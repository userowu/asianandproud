                <p> Mainstream media often portrays Asian people as those</p>
                <p> only with East Asian descent. How often have you been exposed </p>
                <p> to only Korean, Japanese, or Chinese representation as the only "Asia?" </p>
                <p> Not to mention, Hollywood East Asian representation is still rare and </p>
                <p> mediocre at best. The poor representation of South and Southeast Asians are </p>
                <p> constantly overlooked, and not necessarily due to East Asian representation. </p>
                <p> It is the fault of millionaire studios, producers, writers, directors who </p>
                <p> will not spare a second to write stories of these major ethnic groups. </p>

              <p> Hey! My name is Ling. I am a senior high school student in </p>
              <p> the Bay Area. I currently am taking 6 AP classes, and I </p>
              <p> have a 4.0 GPA throughout all my years at school. Math and science </p>
              <p> are my favorite subjects. I play piano every weekend, and I </p>
              <p> tutor my peers in calculus in my free time. I am not very good </p>
              <p> at driving either. How long did you continue reading until you </p>
              <p> realized that I was lying about all of that? </p>
              <br>
              <p> The model minority myth is a stereotype that is often used </p>
              <p> to categorize Asian people. Phrases such as "Wow! You are good
              <p> at math, right? Because you are Asian!" or "Asians are super  </p>
              <p> smart!" are examples of microaggressions used against Asian people. </p>
              <p> These comments are commonly used in situations ignorantly </p>
              <p> to either "compliment" and diminish an Asian person's accomplishments. </p>
              <p> There is no such thing as a good stereotype because all stereotypes </p>
              <p> limit and box individuals into characterizations that do not define </p>
              <p> their actual person. By validating stereotypes, you see the person </p>
              <p> through a prejudiced lens. And many Asians suffer under the pressure of </p>
              <p> trying to meet those unwarranted expectations when in reality, Asians </p>
              <p> are ordinary humans who want to be respected </p>
              <p> and seen as their own individual. </p>
